            <p>Dear Diary,</p>
            <p>I hope nobody ever reads you... I put some pretty important stuff in here. It's okay, I'll just put the secret stuff in code and hide the cipher.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I'm so mad at the Director! So I think I'll just use some <b>vuoyut</b>.</p>
            <p>It'll be just like when they killed <b>Caesar!</b>. Except this will be <b>6x better.</b></p>
            <p>I just need to not mess it up, since I'm so <b>irasye</b>...</p>
